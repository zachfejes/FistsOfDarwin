The different species in the game will encompas creatures from the shale, and also some assumed lead-up evolutions to those. 10 different potential lifeforms overall.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aysheaia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucigenia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opabinia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalocaris
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilobite
These are the primary 5 from the Burgess Shale deposit. The leadup evolutions would be:
1. Amoeba
2. Multicellular organism
3. Between Lobopods and Anomalocarid
4. Between Anomalocarid and Anomalocaris
5. Between Anomalocaris and Arthropods

Should also make algae-like model and kelp/seaweed like models. Also bubbles, rocks, etc.

Zach will have to make a model/animation for each of these (probably a 'not-moving' animation and a 'moving' animation
