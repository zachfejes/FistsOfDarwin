Ideas:

Tree of life
	see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossils_of_the_Burgess_Shale
	10 forms
		tree based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossils_of_the_Burgess_Shale#See_also
~ 5 minute playthrough
deterministic ending
"millions of years" counter to count play time
soft cut two switch b/w stages
	ie something passes in front of you for a moment before the level-up
	hide the evolution and skip timer ahead some amount to show time passing



Ending:
dust storm 
	fade out
	fade into fossil display showing your playthrough
	show both modelled fossil and real one?
		include where to find it in gallery?

Things to decide:
	Top-down? full 3D?
		-resolution: contanst forward, control up/down/left/right
